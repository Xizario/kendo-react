## Description
I want to adapt the `rowSpan` value in a TileLayout based on the height of its contents. Currently, I have set the `colSpan` and `rowSpan` to a static number, but this results in white space when there is less data in the grid.

## Solution

To dynamically adjust the `rowSpan` value based on the content height, create a function that obtains the Grid height and recalculates it based on your needs.


{% meta id height:500 %}
{% embed_file layout/tilelayout-adapt-rowspan-content-dynamically/main.jsx preview %}
{% endmeta %}
