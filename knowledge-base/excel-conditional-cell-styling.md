## Description

I want to apply conditional cell styling in the ExcelExport component within my application. Specifically, I need to format cells as bold based on the presence of a `is_total` flag in the row data. However, the `is_total` flag should not be included in the exported Excel data.

## Solution

To achieve conditional cell styling in the ExcelExport, set a flag variable to the exported data and apply the required styles if the flag is set to `true`

{% meta id:index height:330 %}
{% embed_file excel/excel-conditional-styling.jsx preview %}
{% endmeta %}
